Make sure to look through already asked and answered questions (closed issues) to make sure you are not asking a duplicate question. You are allowed to show a minimal example of your own code that reproduces the problem you are having. You can't ask for straight solutions to your problem, just as others are not allowed to post their full answers. Frame your question like you would in class.
